# Security Policy

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Overview

HyperDAG is built with security as a fundamental principle. This document outlines our security practices, vulnerability reporting process, and security guarantees.

## üîí Security Features

### Memory Safety
- **Address Sanitizer (ASan)**: Detects buffer overflows, use-after-free, and memory leaks
- **Undefined Behavior Sanitizer (UBsan)**: Catches undefined behavior at runtime
- **Memory Safety Architecture**: Cache-aligned structures with proper bounds checking
- **Static Analysis**: Comprehensive clang-tidy, Cppcheck, and PVS-Studio integration

### Build Security
- **Reproducible Builds**: Deterministic compilation with SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH
- **Hardening Flags**: Stack protectors, fortify source, PIE, and RELRO
- **Supply Chain Security**: SLSA v1.1 provenance generation
- **Cryptographic Attestation**: GitHub build attestations and SBOM generation

### Code Quality
- **Nuclear-Level Warnings**: Maximum compiler strictness across GCC/Clang/MSVC
- **Fuzzing**: Continuous fuzzing with libFuzzer and AFL++
- **Static Analysis**: Multiple tools including Semgrep, CodeQL, and custom checks
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection for all dependencies

## üö® Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## üìã Security Standards Compliance

- **SLSA Level 3**: Supply chain integrity with cryptographic provenance
- **CWE Top 25**: Protection against most dangerous software weaknesses
- **OWASP C/C++**: Following OWASP secure coding practices
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management alignment

## üêõ Vulnerability Reporting

### How to Report

**DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing:
- **Primary**: security@hyperdag.org
- **Alternative**: Use GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)

### What to Include

Please include the following information:
- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and attack scenarios
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step reproduction instructions
- **Environment**: Operating system, compiler version, build configuration
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or commands demonstrating the issue

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Regular Updates**: Every 7 days during investigation
- **Resolution**: Target 90 days for critical issues, 180 days for others

## üîç Security Testing

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Run comprehensive security test suite
./scripts/security-audit.sh

# Run fuzzing tests
cmake -DHYPERDAG_FUZZING=ON -B build-fuzz
cmake --build build-fuzz
./build-fuzz/tests/fuzz/fuzz_graph

# Memory safety testing
cmake -DHYPERDAG_SANITIZERS=ON -B build-asan
cmake --build build-asan
ASAN_OPTIONS="abort_on_error=1" ./build-asan/bin/hyperdag_unit_tests
```

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Input validation testing
- [ ] Buffer overflow testing
- [ ] Integer overflow testing
- [ ] Memory corruption testing
- [ ] Race condition testing
- [ ] Cryptographic implementation review

## üèÜ Security Guarantees

### What We Guarantee
1. **Memory Safety**: No buffer overflows in release builds
2. **Input Validation**: All external inputs are validated
3. **No Hardcoded Secrets**: No embedded credentials or keys
4. **Secure Defaults**: Security-by-default configuration
5. **Regular Updates**: Timely security patches

### What We Don't Guarantee
1. **Side-Channel Resistance**: Not designed for cryptographic applications
2. **Real-Time Guarantees**: Performance may vary under attack
3. **Physical Security**: Protection against hardware attacks
4. **Social Engineering**: Protection against human factors
